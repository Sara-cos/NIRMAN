## Problem Statement
Due to improper traffic management, there is a lot of congestion on most of the roads of
busy places. This hampers productivity, and increases irritation. A proper management of
traffic can lead to a way better city life, save fuel, and reduce pollution.
Also, a lot of accidents happen at crossroads, and at night, or in case of an empty street,
there is no one to help the victims. Countless people lose their lives due to lack of help,
when this situation can be avoided.


## Solution Approach
We provide solution to these issues with the help of computer vision and machine learning,
where the traffic signals can be automated to be dynamic in nature instead of the regular
timed stoppage and passage. This dynamic flow, with respect to vehicle density at each
lane, will help dissipate the crowd faster with much greater efficiency, and hence reduce
congestion dramatically.
The model would also be able to see and detect accidents, and would inform the nearest
hospital about the incident, who would send ambulance right to the spot, all without any
human intervention
