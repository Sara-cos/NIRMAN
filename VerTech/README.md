# VerTech

## Problem Statement
When we join any college as a fresher we find it difficult to communicate with
the seniors and fellow peers. Also we remain confused to which domain to
start with.In our personal experience we felt that there was a huge communication
gap and lack of learninresources...

## Proposed Solution
Vertech is an ad free instant messaging and digital distribution platform where tech enthusiasts can jam with peers of their respective domains and collaborate on different projects. A league can share feeds of their amuse or new ideas of their respective domain. Many innovative ideas , projects can be cultivated on this user-friendly platform. The user can also maintain a to-do list of the projects to be done with his/her respective team mates. To avoid any delay in the flow of ideas, the user will have the liberty to have secure conversations through messaging with his peers.
