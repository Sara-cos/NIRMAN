## Problem Statement
Most farmers grow crops that have been handed down to them by their family or one that they thought was profitable by observing their neieghbouring crops.
Due to this farmers are unable to maximize the utilisation of their land.
So the problem statement a crises as follows:
Lack of a specific method/implementatin for farmers to produce and export quality non-traditional crops.

## Solution Approach
### To design a system for providing farmers with farming plans to grow various crops.
We have impllemented this as a website which can be accesed by farmers as well as a middle-man who can help farmers understand the site.
This website provides personalised crop plan to maximise crop utiliisation and profit.
