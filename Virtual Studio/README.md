# NIRMAN - TEAM VIRTUAL STUDIO 

## Problem Statement
### Theme - OPEN INNOVATION
  Much often we cannot believe in the things we fail to visualize. Owning a property is one such uphill task. And the middleclass man finds it even harder because of the   underlying process linked to buying a property. Starting from going through the blueprints, locations, price, loans to what furniture to fit. The middleclass primarily   worries about the amount of time, effort and money he will have to invest before finding a suitable property. Owning a property seems like a scattered process to him.    First, he’ll have to check through real estate websites, confirm the blueprints and legality of the property and then finalize interiors. All this not only needs time    but includes additional expenses to the already troubled man.

## Solution Approach

  The objective is to enable Virtual Showroom-like experience inside an unfurnished house/hotel room to view how it would look after furnishment Through our “Visual Studio” we aim to give a single view of a furnished home with best of utilities to the middleclass man. We cannot dream of something unless we see it with our open eyes. In today’s world time is money. Visual studio will help the buyer to save both his money and time. It will provide a realistic view of the property with curated interiors suiting to the property with the help of computer-generated images through few clicks. It will show the price estimation of every article along wide price range and varieties that the buyer wishes to add in the residence. This is a zero-time consuming and cost effective as it prevents one from making multiple visits to the property every time there’s a change in the property’s status. Viewing a well-furnished residence will give a sense of clarity to the buyer that whether or not he wants to own the property. Integrating Ecommerce platforms to the Virtual Studio itself so that people can buy the desired products in just a few clicks through us.

Future Plans- Using machine learning automatically assigning furniture to the room designated so that no human intervention is needed in order to develop an interior design of a house. A belt in market space for buying of every article placed using Virtual studio.
